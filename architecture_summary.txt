Architecture Change Summary

Initial Development Phase

July 2025
- Core application structure established with primary entry points
- Created main.c and main2.c as foundational components of the system
- Basic architecture framework implemented across core modules

The current architecture consists of a dual-main structure with separate execution paths through main.c and main2.c components. This represents the initial foundation for the codebase with core functionality distributed across these primary modules.
